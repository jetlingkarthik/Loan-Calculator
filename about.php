 <ul>
   <li><p class="lead">Principal amount: The principal amount refers to the actual sum of money that is borrowed by the lender. Beyond question, the principal amount is a major determining factor towards the EMI that is to be paid by you.</p></li>
   <li><p class="lead">Rate of interest: The rate of interest is the rate at which the borrower has taken money from an organization or market. This is the most important factor when it comes to determining your EMI. The higher the rate of interest, the greater is the EMI payable by you. It is always advisable to do a market study of various interest rates offered by lending bodies and then decide upon a particular product.</p></li>
   <li><p class="lead">Loan tenure: The tenure of the loan refers to the duration for which the loan has been taken. The longer the duration of the loan, the lesser the monthly EMI burden on the borrower.</p></li>
